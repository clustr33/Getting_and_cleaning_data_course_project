## Introduction

This repository contains my submission for the course project in Getting and Cleaning Data course.

## Description

Raw data was collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone in six different activities by different subjects (<a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
">UCI HAR data set</a>). The purpose of this project was to calculate the means of different raw measurements against the activities and subjects.

 * Execute run_analysis.R script from a directory that contains the unzipped UCI HAR Dataset subdirectory
 * The script will produce tidy.txt as an output for the digested means of 66 variables
 * Code book is described in CodeBook.md
